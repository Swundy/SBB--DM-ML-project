There should be one code notebook per team, but all team members can participate and contribute code. \n","\n","You can use either direct the Kaggle API and your Kaggle credentials (as explained below and **entirely optional**), or dowload the data form Kaggle and upload it onto your team's GitHub repository under the data subfolder.\n","\n","#### 4. 💎 Train your models and upload the code under your team's GitHub repo.
